June 3 2016
============
Code 1111
--  As at the above date I have already written most of the classes and methods inside "classes" folder and most are working fine, some need to be tested on a live server and some are not working fine-part of which I have fixed and the other part I am fixing

June 9 2016
============
Code 1112
--  I have put the folders classes, config, and lib in a folder called app for proper view of project folder

--  Done with email validation on login page

--  Fixed the confirm_user_reg.php

June 10 2016
============
Code 1113
--  I change the name recover.php to pass_recovery.php
--  I made the processing page for the pass_recovery.php for users to recover their password
--  The processing page calls method from the class Functions_User to process
--  I created another page called confirm_pass.php, so that when user click on pass_recovery link the former page would process it
--  I made the jquery xmlrequest also for the pass_recovery processing
--  I created a database field to store user login, logoff status and time for future use
--  I called the email validating method to validate the email field for the login page
--  We will move on from there, I need to go and sleep now it 4:25am thanks Dika for your effort

June 10 2016
============
Code 1114
--  We don't have to start configuring the application path in the javascript again
--  I have made it to auto write during installation just like the config.ini
--  The config.js must therefore be always put at the top of any page in case another js file wants to use the configuration
